The purpose of Food Logger is to allow the user to keep track of the type, quantity and nutritional value of food eaten over time. The interface permits the following operations:

    A form is presented to the user into which they can enter the name of the food eaten, the date it was eaten, and the quantity in grams of the food eaten. Only foods that exist in the application database are permitted. This limitation is enforced by an autocomplete function implemented in the food name field. As the user types in this field, suggestions acquired on the fly are presented. The user can select one of these suggestions or can choose to add a food.
    

2. **Add a food item (to the application database)**
